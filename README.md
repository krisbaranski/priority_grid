# Priority Grid

</div>

#### Video Demo:

### Description:

#### Webapp made in Flask, Python, JavaScript, SQLite3, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap.

This app is made - as its name already say - to specify, what your priorities are (in right order).

For that, i implemented some code, where you can specify important properties as a list.

Then, going through a random loop, these properties are shown as pairs, where you can choose only one, which is more of value.

In the end, you will get an "ordered" list, where the property on top have the most "clicks" and last one the least "clicks".

Thats how your properties will give a result of priority grid. From most to least important.

You can make as many headings as you like or need. You can also run your "test" again after reset.

I hope it can help you and make your priorities work for you!

### Enjoy!
