# Priority Grid

### Webapp made in Flask, Python, JavaScript, SQLite3, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap.

### This app is made - as its name already say - to specify or clearify what your priorities are, made in right order.

For that i implemented some code, where you can specify some important properties, just as a list.

Then, going through a random loop, these properties will be shown as pairs,

where you can choose only one which is more of value.

In the end, you will get a "ordered" list, where the one on top will have the most "clicks" and as last the least "clicks".

Thats how your properties will give a result of priority grid. From most to least important.

You can make as many headings as you like or need.

### Enjoy!
